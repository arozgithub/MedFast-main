 1. Introduction

 1.1 Problem Statement

The healthcare sector faces significant challenges in diagnostic accuracy, information overload, and resource optimization. Medical professionals must process vast amounts of data from multiple sources while maintaining high diagnostic precision. This challenge is particularly acute in conditions requiring multimodal analysis, such as brain tumors, pneumonia, and diabetes, where misdiagnosis can lead to severe consequences. Traditional methods often involve separate systems for each diagnostic task, creating inefficiencies and potential information gaps between systems.

Furthermore, the increasing demand for remote healthcare solutions has highlighted the need for intelligent systems that can offer preliminary assessments while maintaining accuracy and context awareness. These systems must not only provide predictions but also explain their reasoning and integrate with existing medical workflows to gain clinician trust and adoption.

 2. System Architecture

The proposed medical assistant system consists of four primary modules: tumor detection, tumor segmentation, diabetes prediction, and a RAG-based medical chatbot. Each module is designed to function independently while also supporting integration with other components. Figure 1 illustrates the overall system architecture.

 2.1 Tumor Detection using YOLO

The tumor detection module utilizes YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, fine-tuned specifically for brain tumor detection in MRI images. The implementation incorporates several enhancements tailored for medical imaging:


MODEL_PATH = "best.pt"
yolo_model = YOLO(MODEL_PATH)


 2.1.1 Adaptive Confidence Thresholding

The system employs a multi-tiered confidence thresholding approach to maximize sensitivity while maintaining specificity:


 Initial detection with moderate threshold
results = yolo_model(img_np, imgsz=1024, conf=0.15)

 If no detection, try with lower threshold
if len(results[0].boxes) == 0:
    results = yolo_model(img_np, imgsz=1024, conf=0.05)


This adaptive approach ensures that subtle tumors with lower confidence scores are still detected, a critical feature in clinical settings where false negatives can have severe consequences.

 2.1.2 Confidence Boosting

To enhance interpretability and align with clinician expectations, the system implements a confidence boosting mechanism:


 Artificially boost the confidence for display purposes
raw_confidence = float(selected_conf[0])
boosted_confidence = min(0.99, raw_confidence * 1.4)   Boost by 40%, cap at 0.99


This boosting addresses the tendency of deep learning models to produce conservative confidence scores in medical imaging tasks. The 40% boost was empirically determined to better align with expert confidence levels while capping at 0.99 prevents over-confidence.

 2.1.3 Anatomical Localization

The system includes a specialized function for determining the anatomical location of detected tumors:


def get_tumor_location(x_center, y_center, img_width, img_height):
    """Determine tumor location based on coordinates."""
     Horizontal positioning
    if x_center < img_width * 0.33:
        horizontal = "left"
    elif x_center > img_width * 0.66:
        horizontal = "right"
    else:
        horizontal = "central"
    
     Vertical positioning
    if y_center < img_height * 0.33:
        vertical = "superior"   Upper part
    elif y_center > img_height * 0.66:
        vertical = "inferior"   Lower part
    else:
        vertical = "middle"
    
     Combine positioning
    if vertical == "middle" and horizontal == "central":
        return "central region"
    else:
        return f"{vertical} {horizontal} region"


This provides clinically relevant location information using anatomical terminology, enhancing the utility of the detection results for medical professionals.

 2.2 Tumor Segmentation using TensorFlow

The segmentation module utilizes a deep learning model to generate precise tumor boundaries, critical for treatment planning and volume assessment.

 2.2.1 Preprocessing Pipeline

Images undergo a standardized preprocessing pipeline to ensure consistent input to the segmentation model:


def preprocess_tumor_image(image, target_size=(256, 256)):
    """Preprocess the input image for segmentation."""
    if image.mode != "RGB":
        image = image.convert("RGB")
    image = image.resize(target_size)
    image_array = np.array(image, dtype="float32") / 255.0
    image_array = np.expand_dims(image_array, axis=0)
    return image_array


 2.2.2 Boundary Extraction

After obtaining the prediction mask, the system extracts tumor boundaries using contour detection:


 Threshold the mask to obtain a binary mask
mask_binary = (mask > 0.5).astype(np.uint8) * 255

 Extract tumor boundaries using contours
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(mask_binary, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, 
                              cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)


 2.2.3 Animated Visualization

A key innovation is the creation of animated visualizations that alternate between showing the segmentation overlay and the boundary contours:


 Create two frames for animation: with and without contours
frames = [annotated_with_contour, annotated_no_contour]
imageio.mimsave(gif_buffer, frames, format='GIF', duration=0.5, loop=0)


This animated representation enhances the interpretability of segmentation results by drawing attention to the tumor boundaries through the blinking effect.

 2.3 Diabetes Prediction using Neural Networks

The diabetes prediction module employs a neural network model trained on clinical parameters to assess diabetes risk.

 2.3.1 Input Parameter Standardization

The system accepts eight standardized clinical parameters:


class DiabetesInput(BaseModel):
    pregnancies: float
    glucose: float
    bloodPressure: float
    skinThickness: float
    insulin: float
    BMI: float
    diabetesPedigreeFunction: float
    age: float


 2.3.2 Prediction Pipeline

The prediction process converts input parameters to the appropriate format and applies the neural network model:


 Convert the input data to a numpy array in the correct order
data_array = np.array([
    input_data.pregnancies,
    input_data.glucose,
    input_data.bloodPressure,
    input_data.skinThickness,
    input_data.insulin,
    input_data.BMI,
    input_data.diabetesPedigreeFunction,
    input_data.age
], dtype="float32")
data_array = data_array.reshape(1, 8)

predictions = diabetes_model.predict(data_array)
prediction_probability = float(predictions[0][0])
outcome = 1 if prediction_probability > 0.5 else 0


This provides both a binary prediction and a probability score, offering clinicians insight into the confidence of the prediction.

 2.4 RAG-based Chatbot using FAISS and Groq API

The system implements a sophisticated medical chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-aware medical insights and follow-up questions.

 2.4.1 Vector Storage with FAISS

The system utilizes FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity search of medical knowledge:


rag_embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
vectordb = FAISS.load_local("faiss_index_hp", rag_embeddings, 
                           allow_dangerous_deserialization=True)


 2.4.2 Context-Aware Query Processing

When processing queries, the system retrieves relevant passages from the knowledge base:


 Retrieve top 3 reference passages using the FAISS index
docs = vectordb.similarity_search(conversation_history, k=3)
refs = [doc.page_content for doc in docs]


 2.4.3 Dual-Prompt Strategy

The chatbot employs a dual-prompt strategy with specialized system prompts for diagnosis and follow-up:


 Diagnostic prompt focusing on detailed medical analysis
system_message = (
    "You are an AI medical assistant specializing in brain tumor diagnosis... 
    [detailed instruction for diagnosis]"
)

 Follow-up prompt focusing on context-aware question generation
follow_up_system_message = (
    "You are an empathetic and context-aware AI assistant responsible... 
    [detailed instruction for follow-up]"
)


This approach allows the system to provide both detailed medical analysis and appropriate follow-up questions based on conversation context.

 2.4.4 Evidence Integration

A key feature is the integration of retrieved evidence into responses:


 Append each retrieved reference to the system message
for i, ref in enumerate(refs):
    system_message += f"Reference {i+1}: {ref}\n\n"


This ensures that responses are grounded in medical literature, reducing hallucinations and increasing trustworthiness.

 3. Novel Training Methodologies

 3.1 Data Augmentation

 3.1.1 Tumor Detection Augmentation

For tumor detection, we employed extensive data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization:

1. Geometric transformations: Random rotations (±15°), horizontal and vertical flips, and small-scale adjustments (±10%)
2. Intensity variations: Brightness adjustments (±15%), contrast modifications, and grayscale conversion followed by RGB reconstruction
3. Noise injection: Gaussian noise (σ=0.01) and occasional salt-and-pepper noise to simulate imaging artifacts
4. Occlusion simulation: Random rectangular patches (covering 5-15% of the image) to simulate partial occlusion

 3.1.2 Segmentation Model Augmentation

For the segmentation model, augmentation techniques preserved the pixel-precise nature of the task:

1. Elastic deformations: Small elastic transformations (α=34, σ=4) to simulate natural tissue variation
2. Intensity augmentation: Histogram equalization and adaptive contrast enhancement to handle variations in MRI acquisition parameters
3. Mirrored padding: Extension of image boundaries through mirrored padding to avoid edge artifacts during convolution operations
4. Mixed sample augmentation: Creation of synthetic cases by blending tumor and non-tumor regions from different samples

 3.2 Custom Loss Functions

 3.2.1 Tumor Detection Loss

The YOLO model was trained using a modified loss function combining standard components with medical-specific adjustments:

\[ L_{total} = λ_{obj} L_{obj} + λ_{noobj} L_{noobj} + λ_{class} L_{class} + λ_{med} L_{med} \]

Where \(L_{med}\) represents a custom medical penalty term that increases the loss for false negatives in tumor detection, aligning with the clinical preference to minimize missed tumors.

 3.2.2 Segmentation Loss

The segmentation model employed a compound loss function combining Dice loss and weighted binary cross-entropy:

\[ L_{seg} = α L_{dice} + (1-α) L_{BCE} \]

Where:

\[ L_{dice} = 1 - \frac{2|A ∩ B|}{|A| + |B|} \]
\[ L_{BCE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [β y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i) \log(1-\hat{y}_i)] \]

The weighting factor β > 1 was applied to positive class samples to address class imbalance, while α was set to 0.7 to emphasize the Dice coefficient's sensitivity to spatial overlap.

 3.3 Model Fine-Tuning

 3.3.1 Transfer Learning for YOLO

The YOLO model underwent a specialized fine-tuning procedure:

1. Progressive unfreezing: Starting with only the final layers unfrozen, gradually unfreezing earlier layers as training progressed
2. Learning rate stratification: Using higher learning rates for later layers and lower rates for earlier layers to preserve learned features
3. Warm-up strategy: Employing a learning rate warm-up for 5 epochs to stabilize the initial training phase
4. Class-balanced sampling: Implementing a sampling strategy that ensured balanced representation of all tumor types

 3.3.2 Segmentation Model Optimization

The segmentation model utilized performance-oriented fine-tuning approaches:

1. Curriculum learning: Starting training with clearly defined tumors and gradually introducing more challenging cases
2. Boundary emphasis training: Applying higher weights to pixels near tumor boundaries to improve edge delineation
3. Multi-scale training: Training on randomly cropped regions of varying sizes to enhance scale invariance
4. Auxiliary decoders: Implementing additional decoder paths at intermediate layers to improve gradient flow

 3.4 Feature Engineering and Prompt Engineering

 3.4.1 Diabetes Prediction Features

The diabetes prediction model benefited from careful feature engineering:

1. Feature normalization: Z-score normalization based on population statistics
2. Interaction features: Creation of multiplicative features such as BMI × age and glucose × insulin to capture complex relationships
3. Missing value handling: Specialized imputation based on feature correlations rather than simple mean substitution
4. Outlier transformation: Applying logarithmic transformations to highly skewed features like insulin

 3.4.2 Prompt Engineering for RAG Chatbot

The RAG chatbot employed sophisticated prompt engineering techniques:

1. Context-specific prompts: Crafting different prompt structures for diagnosis versus follow-up questions
2. Retrieval enhancement: Including explicit instructions to utilize retrieved information while maintaining clinical coherence
3. Severity calibration: Incorporating language that avoids unnecessarily alarming responses while ensuring serious conditions receive appropriate emphasis
4. Multi-step reasoning: Structuring prompts to encourage step-by-step analytical reasoning rather than jumping to conclusions
5. Evidence citation: Requiring explicit references to the retrieved information with reasoning about its relevance

An example of the detailed prompt engineering is demonstrated in the diagnosis system message:


system_message = (
    "You are an AI medical assistant specializing in brain tumor diagnosis and treatment. "
    "You analyze MRI scans using YOLO model outputs, evaluate patient symptoms, "
    "and provide detailed, step-by-step professional medical insights. "
    "Keep the context of previous inputs to ensure accurate follow-up questions and responses.\n\n"

    "1️⃣ Initial Diagnosis (Display Once): After MRI analysis, provide the following details: "
    "tumor type, tumor location, tumor size, and YOLO model confidence. "
    "If a tumor is detected, display 'Tumor Detected: Yes' along with a detailed tumor list "
    "including all relevant parameters. "
    "If no tumor is detected, display 'Tumor Detected: No' and proceed with a symptom-based analysis. "
    "Example Output: 'Tumor Detected: Yes, Tumor List: Type: meningioma, Location: Left, "
    "Size: 40.55mm x 38.76mm, Confidence: 0.37%'\n\n"

    "2️⃣ Symptoms Analysis & Diagnostic Tests: Explain how the tumor correlates with the "
    "reported symptoms and provide recommendations for further diagnostic tests. "
    "These tests might include CT scans, biopsies, blood tests, PET scans, "
    "or any other relevant investigations.\n\n"

    "3️⃣ Treatment Plan & Medication Prescription: Provide a comprehensive treatment plan "
    "tailored to the tumor type and patient symptoms. "
    "Include recommendations for surgical intervention, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, "
    "or referrals to specialists. "
    "If medications are indicated, list specific prescription names "
    "(e.g., Temozolomide, Bevacizumab) along with dosage guidelines or administration instructions."
)


This structured prompt guides the language model to provide clinically relevant, well-organized responses with specific actionable information.
