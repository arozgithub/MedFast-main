# MedFast

MedFast is an integrated medical diagnosis platform that combines advanced computer vision models and natural language processing to assist in clinical decision-making. The project includes endpoints for pneumonia detection, brain tumor detection/segmentation, and diabetes prediction. It also features an interactive chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide evidence-based recommendations by retrieving relevant passages from a reference textbook.

## Features

- **Pneumonia Detection:**  
  Uses a TensorFlow/Keras model to analyze chest X-ray images (converted to grayscale) and classify them as "Normal" or "Pneumonia Detected." The endpoint returns an annotated image.

- **Tumor Detection & Segmentation:**  
  - **Tumor Detection:** Uses a YOLO model (from a `.pt` file) to detect brain tumors in MRI scans, returning tumor details (type, size, location, confidence) along with an annotated image.
  - **Tumor Segmentation:** Uses a Keras segmentation model (from a `.h5` file) to generate a tumor mask and produce an animated GIF with blinking boundaries that highlight the tumor.

- **Diabetes Prediction:**  
  Accepts several clinical predictor variables (e.g., pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure) and uses a pre-trained model to predict diabetes risk, returning a probability and outcome.

- **Chatbot with RAG:**  
  A React-based chatbot that interacts with users by handling symptom queries, retrieving relevant textbook references (via a FAISS index built using LangChain community modules), and generating evidence-based diagnostic and treatment recommendations using the Groq API.

Installation
Backend Setup
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MedFast.git
cd MedFast/backend
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
Windows:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install Backend Dependencies
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure your requirements.txt includes:

fastapi

uvicorn

tensorflow

keras

ultralytics

langchain-community (or langchain-huggingface, if applicable)

faiss-cpu

pdfplumber

pandas

tqdm

imageio

Generate the FAISS Index (if not already present)
If you haven’t created your reference embeddings yet, run:

bash
Copy
python extract_text_and_save_index.py
This command will create a folder (e.g., faiss_index_hp) containing the FAISS index files (index.faiss and index.pkl).

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the Frontend Directory
bash
Copy
cd ../frontend
Install Frontend Dependencies
bash
Copy
npm install
Running the Application
Start the Backend
From the MedFast/backend directory, launch the FastAPI server:

bash
Copy
uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Your backend should now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Start the Frontend
In a separate terminal, navigate to the MedFast/frontend directory and start the React development server:

bash
Copy
npm start
Typically, the frontend runs on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Pneumonia Detection:
Upload a chest X-ray image using the XRayAnalysis component. The application processes the image and returns an annotated version indicating whether pneumonia is detected.

Tumor Detection & Segmentation:

Tumor Detection:
Access the /detect_tumor/ endpoint to identify brain tumors in MRI scans using the YOLO model.

Tumor Segmentation:
Use the /detect_tumor_h5/ endpoint to obtain a tumor mask and view the results as an animated GIF.

Diabetes Prediction:
Fill out the DiabetesDetection form with the necessary predictor variables to receive a diabetes risk prediction along with an associated probability.

Chatbot with RAG:
Interact with the chatbot (found in chatbot.jsx) to ask symptom-related questions. The chatbot retrieves relevant textbook references via a FAISS index and uses the Groq API to provide evidence-based recommendations.

Deployment
Free Deployment Options
Hugging Face Spaces:
Deploy your FastAPI backend (or a Gradio/Streamlit app) on Hugging Face Spaces using a Docker container.

Deta Micros:
Host your backend on Deta Micros for a free deployment solution.

Docker Deployment
To containerize the application, create a Dockerfile in the repository root with the following content:

dockerfile
Copy
FROM python:3.8-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY backend/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY backend/ .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
Then, build and run the container with the following commands:

bash
Copy
docker build -t medfast-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 medfast-backend
Environment Variables
If your application relies on environment variables (for instance, the Groq API key), create a .env file in the backend directory or configure them directly in your system. Example:

bash
Copy
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
You can use a package like python-dotenv to load these variables when needed.
